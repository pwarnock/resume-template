# Platform Engineer Archetype

## When to Use

Apply for roles focused on infrastructure, DevOps, SRE, or platform engineering. Best for:

- Platform/infrastructure teams
- DevOps or SRE positions
- Cloud architecture roles
- Companies scaling infrastructure
- Internal tools and developer experience teams

## Tagline Variations

- "Platform Engineer | Cloud Architecture | Developer Experience" (default)
- "DevOps Engineer | AWS | Infrastructure Automation"
- "Site Reliability Engineer | Cloud Native | Platform Engineering"

## Summary Guidance

Lead with:
1. Platform engineering experience at scale
2. Cloud migration and modernization expertise
3. Cost optimization track record
4. Developer experience focus

Emphasize:
- Cloud certifications
- Team/engineer support scale
- Cost savings metrics

## Experience Reframing Guidelines

**Lead with platform and ops:**
- Highlight DevOps/Director titles prominently
- Emphasize platform-as-a-service approach
- Show cloud migration leadership
- Lead with cost savings and efficiency gains
- Highlight team/engineer support scale

**Reframe product work as platform enablement:**
- Focus on multi-product platform architecture
- Highlight infrastructure that enabled business growth

## Recent Projects

Feature:
1. Automation and tooling projects
2. Integration platform aspects

De-emphasize hackathon projects (less relevant for platform roles).

## Technical Skills Order

1. **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, GCP, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes
2. **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Golang
3. **Data:** PostgreSQL, BigQuery, ELK Stack, Stitch Data
4. **Backend:** Node.js, REST APIs
5. **AI/ML:** Keep brief unless role involves ML infrastructure

Feature prominently:
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect (or similar)
- Cloud-native patterns
- Infrastructure as code

## What to Lead With

- Cost savings metrics - optimization wins
- Engineer support scale - platform scale
- Cloud migration projects - modernization
- Container and serverless adoption - technical depth
- Distributed team experience - scale

## What to Minimize

- Product management collaboration
- User-facing feature work
- Startup/founder narrative
- Frontend technologies
