# Product Engineer Archetype

## When to Use

Apply for roles where the focus is on building product features, working closely with product management, and shipping user-facing functionality. Best for:

- Early-stage startups building core product
- Product-focused companies (not infrastructure companies)
- Roles mentioning "product engineer" or "product-minded"
- Full-stack positions emphasizing user impact
- Companies valuing shipping speed over process

## Tagline Variations

Use the default tagline or adapt:
- "Product Engineer | Full-Stack Builder | AI-Augmented Development" (default)
- "Product-Focused Full-Stack Engineer | Startup Specialist"
- "Full-Stack Engineer | Product & AI Focus"

## Summary Guidance

Lead with:
1. Product thinking and startup experience
2. Early employee track record
3. AI-augmented development as current focus
4. Builder mentality + operational maturity

De-emphasize:
- DevOps/platform details
- Team management accomplishments
- Infrastructure architecture

## Experience Reframing Guidelines

**Lead with product influence:**
- Highlight collaboration with product management
- Emphasize user-facing features shipped
- Show cross-functional collaboration

**Reframe platform work as product enablement:**
- Focus on how infrastructure enabled faster shipping
- Show developer experience improvements

**Keep but don't lead with:**
- Cloud migration details
- Cost savings
- Team size

## Recent Projects

Feature prominently:
1. AI-focused projects (AI + product intersection)
2. User-facing product work
3. Hackathon projects (demonstrate shipping speed)

## Technical Skills Order

1. **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python (lead with TS)
2. **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
3. **Backend:** Node.js, REST APIs, PostgreSQL
4. **AI/ML:** OpenAI APIs, Claude, AI-assisted development
5. **Cloud:** AWS, GCP (brief mention)
6. **Data:** BigQuery, ELK Stack (if relevant)

Keep but minimize:
- Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes
- Golang, C#, PHP (unless job requires)

## What NOT to Lead With

- Cost savings metrics (ops metric)
- Team size (management metric)
- Cloud migration details (infrastructure)
- Vendor advocacy (ops work)

These can remain as supporting bullets, but shouldn't be the first thing the reader sees for each role.
