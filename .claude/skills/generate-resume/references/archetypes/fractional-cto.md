# Fractional CTO Archetype

## When to Use

Apply for leadership, advisory, or strategic roles. Best for:

- Fractional/part-time CTO positions
- VP Engineering or Head of Engineering
- Technical advisor roles
- Startup advisory boards
- Companies going through M&A
- Organizations needing technical leadership without full-time commitment

## Tagline Variations

- "Engineering Leader | Technical Strategy | Startup Advisor" (default)
- "Fractional CTO | Building & Scaling Engineering Teams"
- "Technical Executive | M&A Experience | Startup to Scale"

## Summary Guidance

Lead with:
1. Total years of experience
2. Companies scaled (early employee trajectory)
3. M&A navigation experience
4. Founder background
5. Current AI/modern stack knowledge

Frame as:
- Strategic leader who can still code
- Bridge between technical and business
- Experienced at navigating transitions

## Experience Reframing Guidelines

**Lead with leadership and navigation:**
- Show both technical and leadership titles
- Emphasize early employee growth trajectory
- Highlight distributed team leadership
- Show acquisition navigation experience
- Emphasize cross-functional liaison work

- Proactive migration decisions
- Cost optimization through strategic vendor management

## Recent Projects

Frame as:
- Staying current with modern tech
- Hands-on capability despite leadership focus
- AI expertise for strategic decisions

## Technical Skills

**Reframe as breadth, not depth:**

"Generalist by design: broad knowledge across the stack to facilitate collaboration between product, engineering, and operations."

Order by strategic relevance:
1. **Leadership:** Technical Strategy, Team Building, M&A Integration
2. **Architecture:** Distributed Systems, Cloud Native, API Design
3. **Cloud:** AWS (Certified), GCP, Terraform
4. **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, Go (breadth over depth)
5. **AI/ML:** Current with AI trends, practical application experience

## What to Lead With

- Total years building software
- Early employee trajectory (multiple startups)
- Acquisitions navigated
- Engineers supported/led
- Founder experience
- Builder mentality + operational maturity

## What to Reframe

- Individual coding -> "Still hands-on, can evaluate technical decisions"
- DevOps work -> "Platform strategy and operational excellence"
- Product collaboration -> "Cross-functional alignment and stakeholder management"

## Certifications

Lead with:
- Cloud certifications - current and relevant
- MBA/Business background if applicable

## Narrative Arc

The resume should tell a story:
1. Started as founder (entrepreneurial DNA)
2. Joined early-stage startups, grew with them
3. Navigated multiple acquisitions successfully
4. Built and led teams through growth
5. Now offering strategic expertise to others
