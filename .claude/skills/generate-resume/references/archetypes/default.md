# Default Archetype

## When to Use

Use this archetype when:
- Sharing resume with anyone who asks (networking)
- No specific role in mind
- Exploring opportunities broadly
- Creating a baseline version

This is the "share with anyone" version that presents a balanced view of experience.

## Philosophy

The default archetype should reflect your current career focus while maintaining enough breadth to be relevant for various opportunities.

If your career focus changes, update this archetype to reflect your new default positioning.

## Tagline

Use a balanced tagline that reflects your primary identity:
- "Software Engineer | Full-Stack Builder | AI-Augmented Development"

## Summary Guidance

Balance these themes:
1. Product thinking AND operational experience
2. Startup experience AND scale
3. Technical depth AND leadership breadth
4. Historical experience AND current AI focus

The summary should make readers think "this person could fit several roles" rather than pigeonholing into one.

## Experience Treatment

Show balanced achievements from each role:

Include both:
- Product influence
- Platform work
- Scale metrics

### Previous Roles
Keep 2-3 bullets each that show variety:
- Technical architecture
- Team/scale growth
- Business impact

## Technical Skills

Present full breadth:
1. **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and others you use
2. **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
3. **Backend:** Node.js, REST APIs, PostgreSQL
4. **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, GCP, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes
5. **AI/ML:** OpenAI APIs, Claude, AI-assisted development
6. **Data:** BigQuery, ELK Stack, Stitch Data

Include the "Generalist by design" note - it's a feature, not a bug.

## Recent Projects

Include all projects to show current activity and breadth.

## Output Location

The default resume should be saved to `src/default.md` (not in jobs/ folder) since it's not tied to a specific application.

## Regenerating

To regenerate the default resume:
```
"Regenerate my default resume"
"Update src/default.md"
```

This will re-apply the default archetype to the current base.md content.
